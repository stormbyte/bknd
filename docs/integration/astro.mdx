## Installation
To get started with Astro and bknd you can either install the package manually, and follow the descriptions below, or use the CLI starter:

<Tabs>
   <Tab title="CLI Starter">
      Create a new Astro CLI starter project by running the following command:

      ```sh
      npx bknd create -i astro
      ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Manual">
      Create a new Astro project by following the [official guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/), and then install bknd as a dependency:

      <InstallBknd />

      <Note>The guide below assumes you're using Astro v4. We've experienced issues with Astro DB
         using v5, see [this issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/12474).</Note>

         For the Astro integration to work, you also need to [add the react integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/):
         ```bash
         npx astro add react
         ```

         You also need to make sure to set the output to `server` in your Astro config:
         ```js {6}
         // astro.config.mjs
         import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
         import react from "@astrojs/react";

         export default defineConfig({
            output: "server",
            integrations: [react()]
         });
         ```

      <Note>
         If you don't want to use React with Astro, there is also an option to serve the bknd Admin UI
         statically using Astro's middleware. In case you're interested in this, feel free to reach
         out in [Discord](https://discord.gg/952SFk8Tb8) or open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/bknd-io/bknd/issues/new).
      </Note>

## Configuration

<Warning>
   When run with Node.js, a version of 22 (LTS) or higher is required. Please verify your version by running `node -v`, and [upgrade](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if necessary.
</Warning>

Now create a `bknd.config.ts` file in the root of your project. If you created the project using the CLI starter, this file is already created for you.

```typescript bknd.config.ts
import type { AstroBkndConfig } from "bknd/adapter/astro";

export default {
   connection: {
      url: "file:data.db"
   }, 
} satisfies AstroBkndConfig;
```

See [bknd.config.ts](/extending/config) for more information on how to configure bknd. The `AstroBkndConfig` type extends the `BkndConfig` type with the following additional properties:

```typescript
type AstroEnv = NodeJS.ProcessEnv;
export type AstroBkndConfig<Env = AstroEnv> = FrameworkBkndConfig<Env>;
```

## Serve the API
Create a helper file to instantiate the bknd instance and retrieve the API, importing the configurationfrom the `bknd.config.ts` file:

```ts src/bknd.ts
import type { AstroGlobal } from "astro";
import { getApp as getBkndApp } from "bknd/adapter/astro";
import config from "../bknd.config";

export { config };

export async function getApp() {
   return await getBkndApp(config);
}

export async function getApi(
   astro: AstroGlobal,
   opts?: { mode: "static" } | { mode?: "dynamic"; verify?: boolean },
) {
   const app = await getApp();
   if (opts?.mode !== "static" && opts?.verify) {
      const api = app.getApi({ headers: astro.request.headers });
      await api.verifyAuth();
      return api;
   }

   return app.getApi();
}
```

Create a new catch-all route at `src/pages/api/[...api].ts`.

```ts src/pages/api/[...api].ts
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/astro";

export const prerender = false;

export const ALL = serve({
   connection: {
      // location of your local Astro DB
      // make sure to use a remote URL in production
      url: "file:.astro/content.db"
   }
});
```

For more information about the connection object, refer to the [Database](/usage/database) guide. In the
special case of astro, you may also use your Astro DB credentials since it's also using LibSQL
under the hood. Refer to the [Astro DB documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/) for more information.

## Enabling the Admin UI
Create a new catch-all route at `src/pages/admin/[...admin].astro`:
```jsx src/pages/admin/[...admin].astro
---
import { Admin } from "bknd/ui";
import "bknd/dist/styles.css";

import { getApi } from "bknd/adapter/astro";

const api = await getApi(Astro, { mode: "dynamic" });
const user = api.getUser();

export const prerender = false;
---

<html>
   <body>
      <Admin
         withProvider={{ user }}
         config={{
            basepath: "/admin",
            color_scheme: "dark",
            logo_return_path: "/../"
         }}
         client:only
      />
   </body>
</html>
```

## Example usage of the API
You use the API in both static and SSR pages. Just note that on static pages, authentication
might not work as expected, because Cookies are not available in the static context.

Here is an example of using the API in static context:
```jsx
---
import { getApi } from "bknd/adapter/astro";
const api = await getApi(Astro);
const { data } = await api.data.readMany("todos");
---

<ul>
   {data.map((todo) => (
      <li>{todo.title}</li>
   ))}
</ul>
```

On SSR pages, you can also access the authenticated user:
```jsx
---
import { getApi } from "bknd/adapter/astro";
const api = await getApi(Astro, { mode: "dynamic" });
const user = api.getUser();
const { data } = await api.data.readMany("todos");

export const prerender = false;
---

{user
   ? <p>Logged in as <b>{user.email}</b>.</p>
   : <p>Not authenticated.</p>}
<ul>
   {data.map((todo) => (
      <li>{todo.title}</li>
   ))}
</ul>
```
